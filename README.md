# NumberSeriesPredictor
Uses genetic algorithms to find a formula that describes any number series. Still has several issues, especially with effiency (and convergence), but it works.

Right now set on matching (2, 4, 6), i.e. the formula 2*x.

Download the repo, run "make", and then run "numberseriespredictor".
