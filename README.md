# NumberSeriesPredictor
Uses genetic algorithms to find a formula that describes any number series. Still has several issues, especially with effiency (and convergence), but it works.

Right now set on matching (4, 7, 10), i.e. the formula 3*x+1.

Download the repo, run "make", and then run "numberseriespredictor". You need to specify population size and two probabilities. Recommended settings are: ./numberseriespredictor 50 0.7 0.01
